== Description ==

This plugin allows you to log in as any user, using any administrator's password. The user can still log in using their own password.

== Upgrade Notice ==
First release

== Installation ==

Standard WordPress plugin installation:

1. Search for "Use Administrator Password" in the WordPress plugin installer
2. Click 'Install'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the configuration settings? =
There are none. If the plugin is active, then you can log in by entering any valid username together with the password of any user with administrator privileges.

= I'd like to change the policy; add some configuration; tweak the plugin slightly, etc. =
Please either send a patch, or make a suitable donation on my donation page, and I will be glad to help. Otherwise, this plugin does all I wanted it to do and I've not got time to develop it further.

= I am locked out / don't know my password / etc. =
That's nothing to do with this plugin. This plugin gives you an *extra* way to validate a login (by knowing an administrator's password), but does nothing else to remove or lock-down any other authentication settings which you have.

= I like automating WordPress, and using the command-line. Please tell me more. =
Glad to hear that! You are looking for WordShell, <a href="http://wordshell.net">http://wordshell.net</a>.
